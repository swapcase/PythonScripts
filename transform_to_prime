Task : 
    
    Given a List [] of n integers , find minimum number to be inserted in a list, so that sum of all elements of list should equal the closest prime number .

Notes

    List size is at least 2 .

    List's numbers will only positives (n > 0) .

    Repetition of numbers in the list could occur .

    The newer list's sum should equal the closest prime number .
